**Overview of the Project**

Project Title - Sales Performance Dashboard

1) Objective: The main objective of this Power BI dashboard project is to provide insightful and actionable analysis on the sales performance across various dimensions. The dashboard aims to help stakeholders make informed decisions by displaying key metrics such as total sales, transactions, operating margin, operating profit, units sold, and pricing trends. It also provides a detailed breakdown of these metrics by product, retailer, region, sales method, and city, enabling better performance tracking and strategic planning.

2) Key Activities:

a) Data Collection and Preparation: Collecting sales and transaction data from various sources (e.g., ERP systems, sales databases, or external files) and ensuring data quality and consistency. This involves cleaning, transforming, and integrating data to make it suitable for analysis.

b) Data Modeling: Structuring the data for use in Power BI by creating relationships between tables (e.g., sales data, product information, transaction details, and retailer data).

c) Key Metric Calculation:

1. Total Sales: Aggregating the revenue from all transactions.
2. Total Transactions: Counting the number of sales transactions.
3. Operating Margin & Operating Profit: Summing up these metrics to assess business profitability.
4. Units Sold: Calculating the total number of products sold.
5. Average Unit Price: Calculating the average selling price of products.
   
d) Segmentation and Aggregation:

1. By Product: Summing total sales and operating profits by product category.
2. By Retailer: Analyzing sales performance by different retailers.
3. By Month: Aggregating total sales by month to identify trends.
4. By Region: Analyzing sales performance across different geographic regions.
5. By Sales Method: Comparing performance by different sales channels or methods.
6. By City: Breaking down total sales and operating profit by city for localized insights.
   
e) Visualizations: Designing interactive charts, graphs, and tables (such as bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and heat maps) to visualize key metrics and insights.


3) Technologies Used:

Power BI: The primary tool used to create the dashboard, including Power Query for data transformation, Power Pivot for data modeling, and Power BI Desktop for report building.

Data Sources: The dashboard can connect to various data sources like Excel files.

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Used to create calculated columns, measures, and aggregations like total sales, operating margin, and profit calculations.

Power BI Service: For sharing and collaborating on the reports with stakeholders and decision-makers.

4) Outcome: The Sales Performance Dashboard provides real-time insights on key business metrics, helping teams monitor and optimize sales performance. By breaking down data by various dimensions, it allows users to quickly identify areas of opportunity or concern and make data-driven decisions.
